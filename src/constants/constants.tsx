        "Another 50 migrants including at least one small girl arrive in Dover as people traffickers step up crossings with good weather on the way Average number of illegal migrants making their way across Channel per boat has reached a new monthly high By James Callery and John James Updated: 16:40, 2 September 2023 e-mail View comments Another 50 migrants including at least one small girl arrived in Dover today as people step up crossings, with high temperatures expected in the UK next week. The migrants were brought in to Dover marina by the RNLI Dover Lifeboat in calm conditions. One image shows a mother clutching her child as an officer walks beside her. The latest crossing comes as the average number of illegal migrants making their way across the Channel per boat has reached a new monthly high. Government data shows 5,369 people made the journey in August in 102 boats - an average of about 53 migrants per vessel and the highest average since records began in 2018. The migrants were brought into Dover marina today by the RNLI Dover Lifeboat in calm conditions Migrants arriving at Dover marina today. A mother is seen clutching her child as an officer walks beside her Around 20,100 migrants have crossed the Channel this year, 20 per cent down on this time in 2022 when more than 25,000 people had crossed. A group of 300 people arrived on Tuesday in five boats - seemingly 'escorted' by a French patrol vessel. Pictures from one of the crossings that day show a dinghy packed with men and boys, some without lifejackets, perched on the sides while their legs dangled in the water. According to witnesses, a nearby French patrol vessel appeared to be escorting and monitoring the boat as it floated into UK waters towards Dover before it was met by Border Force and later taken ashore at the Kent port. Pictures of some of Tuesday's arrivals showed a dinghy packed with men and boys, some without lifejackets, perched on the sides while their legs dangled in the water There have been 5,369 people detected crossing the Channel so far this month, compared with 8,631 recorded in the whole of August 2022 Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the Prime Minister had 'failed to get a grip' on Channel crossings. But Rishi Sunak continued to defend his 'stop the boats' plan as he faced questions from broadcasters and insisted the Government was making progress. He urged people to 'have confidence' in his plan as he claimed the lower number of Channel crossings compared to last year showed it was 'working'. Mr Sunak previously played down suggestions that the lower number of crossings compared with last year was linked to poor weather conditions rather than policy decisions. But this summer has seen more unsettled weather compared with last year when there was a spike in crossings in August. While June 2023 was the warmest on record, July and August have been much more unsettled, with a sequence of low pressure bringing wind and rain.

A heatwave is expected across parts of the UK next week, with temperatures to exceed 30C, which could see more migrants attempting to make the crossing. Sacha Deshmukh, chief executive of Amnesty International UK, said: 'This is another reminder that the Government's failing migration policies won't stop people making perilous journeys to seek asylum.' Ms Cooper told PA: 'Rishi Sunak made this his top priority. He told us that his plan was working. 'And yet these figures show that he's completely failed to get a grip.' She added: 'The Tories' boats chaos is continuing, that's undermining our border security and putting lives at risk. 'In the space of just a few years, the Conservatives have let criminal gangs take hold along the Channel. 'What we need is a proper plan to go after those criminal gangs and to stop the dangerous crossings that are putting lives at risk. That is what Labour would do.' A Home Office spokesman said: 'The unacceptable number of people risking their lives by making these dangerous crossings is placing an unprecedented strain on our asylum system. 'Our priority is to stop the boats, and our Small Boats Operational Command is working alongside our French partners and other agencies to disrupt the people smugglers. 'The Government is going even further through our Illegal Migration Act which will mean that people arriving in the UK illegally are detained and promptly removed to their country of origin or a safe third country.' Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the Prime Minister had 'failed to get a grip' on Channel crossings. But Rishi Sunak continued to defend his 'stop the boats' plan as he faced questions from broadcasters and insisted the Government was making progress (File Photo) There have been 5,369 small boat arrivals so far this month, compared with 8,631 in the whole of August 2022. The new arrivals tally comes after it was revealed migrants who land in the UK in small boats could be forced to wear electronic tags under Home Office proposals. UK charity Refugee Council criticised the plan, claiming it would result in vulnerable people in search of safety being 'treated as mere objects'. A total of 175,457 people were waiting for an initial decision on an asylum application in the UK at the end of June 2023, up 44 per cent from 122,213 at the end of June 2022. This was the highest figure since current records began in 2010. Figures also show the number of asylum seekers waiting more than six months for an initial decision stood at 139,961 at the end of June, up 57 per cent year on year from 89,231 and another record. The idea to tag migrants, first mooted more than a year ago, has resurfaced as Mr Sunak attempts to get a handle on immigration and stop people illegally gaining entry to the UK. A boat carrying around 50 migrants drifts into English waters after being escorted by a French Warship from the French coastline on August 24, 2023 Border Force officials escort 50 migrants to Dover docks after they arrived on the morning of on August 24, 2023 The migrants would be tracked with GPS in real time and required to report via text message or in person to immigration officers multiple times a day, the Telegraph reported. Any attempt to remove the tag and abscond would result in any right to bail or to remain in the UK being automatically withdrawn. A source told The Telegraph: 'Tagging is being discussed as an option.' Refugee Council Chief executive Enver Solomon told The Independent: 'It's treating people as mere objects rather than vulnerable men, women and children in search of safety who should always be treated with compassion and humanity, in the same way we welcomed Ukrainian refugees. 'This is not who we are as a country nor the Britain we aspire to be.' Meanwhile, the Government's plan to accommodate asylum seekers on the Bibby Stockholm barge could face a legal challenge as firefighters accused ministers of a 'callous disregard' for the safety of those onboard. The Bibby Stockholm is one of several sites, which also include former military bases, that ministers want to use to house migrants as they await asylum decisions in an effort to cut the cost of putting them up in hotels and deter entries into the UK via unauthorised means. Addressing the concerns, Home Secretary Suella Braverman told BBC Breakfast: 'Let me be clear that I'm confident barges are safe. 'This barge has accommodated people in the past – asylum seekers, oil rig workers and barges of this kind have been used to accommodate asylum seekers, for example in Scotland, so I'm very confident that this barge is safe for human habitation. 'We followed all of the advice and protocols in anticipation of embarkation.' The Bibby Stockholm barge at Portland Port in Dorset which is housing asylum seekers The Bibby Stockholm accommodation barge the morning after the first asylum seekers moved onboard on August 7 On Friday, an Egyptian man who took selfies while piloting a small boat across the Channel with dozens of migrants on board was jailed, the UK's interior ministry said. The government, under fire for new laws which rights groups insist violate international refugee conventions, welcomed the conviction. Reda Hamoud Abdurabou, 25, was sentenced to three years and two months in prison after being convicted of assisting unlawful immigration to the UK and attempting to enter the country illegally, the ministry added. The sentencing, at Salisbury Crown Court in southern England, follows his arrest in July 2022 after Border Force officials intercepted the 'dangerously overcrowded' inflatable he was piloting. UK officials found images on his seized mobile phone showing him posing with his hand on the motor's tiller earlier in the perilous journey, said the ministry statement. Home Secretary Suella Braverman said she is confident barges are safe firefighters accused ministers of a 'callous disregard' for the safety of those onboard the Bibby Stockholm (File Photo) The Border Force boat carrying migrants from the English Channel arrives into Dover on the morning of August 25 Investigators also found messages on his phone 'about his attempt to reach the UK illegally' along with other selfies taken as he piloted the boat packed with 50 migrants, it added. Under controversial legislation recently passed by the government, immigration officers have new powers to search and seize electronic devices from anyone trying to enter the UK illegally. It also makes any attempts to enter the UK via the Channel or other ports without prior authorisation illegal. That has been heavily criticised by rights groups and international organisations, including United Nations agencies, who argue it flouts the UK's obligations under refugee conventions.

Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates) rounded out the podium just behind, with the trio leading home an elite group which also included Jumbo-Visma men Jonas Vingegaard and Sepp Kuss as well as UAE Team Emirates pairing João Almeida and Marc Soler, and Movistar’s Enric Mas. The result means that Roglič claws back four bonus seconds on Evenepoel, who in turn takes two on Ayuso while Mas, Vingegaard, Almeida, Kuss, and Soler finished a further two seconds back. The red jersey has also changed hands after Lenny Martinez (Groupama-FDJ) dropped early on the double-digit gradients of the final climb. He’d finish 13th at 1:10 down, meaning that Kuss is the new Vuelta race leader. “Nice, eh? Now I’m even more relaxed,” Roglič said after the stage. “It was already nice but most of all I’m happy that I recovered from the crash. Just enjoying now and we go day by day. “You always hope for the best. The guys did a really amazing job, controlling the really strong breakaway. Then we had no option in the end. “It was hard. I did it for the first climb and also I didn’t know the finish really. In the sprint it’s always a bit of a gamble but I had the legs, and I could do it. “At least three now, no? But maybe there’s still someone coming,” he concluded with a joke when asked how many GC leaders his team has. Roglič’s Jumbo-Visma squad had controlled much of the second half of the stage, drilling the pace into the final of five categorised climbs of the day and hauling back the breakaway survivors on the way up. Kuss was the first to try an attack on the harrowing gradients on the way up Xorret de Catí, leaving Evenepoel to lead the chase with Roglič and Vingegaard marking him among the elite selection that would eventually go to the finish. The American couldn’t make his solo go to the line though, with Evenepoel eventually leading the group across 4.2km out and a kilometre from the top. At the back, Almeida, Soler and then Kuss struggled to keep the pace that Evenepoel set all the way to the top. However, they – and Mas, who struggled on the fast descent – all made it back for the final run to the line. Evenepoel, who had been on the front for 5km, led out the final sprint, too, but he wouldn’t be the man to lead the way across the line. Instead it was Roglič who burst past in the closing metres with Ayuso rounding out the podium not far behind as a two-second gap opened up to Vingegaard and the rest. How it unfolded After a hectic sprint day on Friday, the weekend would bring the Vuelta a España peloton back to the hills with stage 8 and a climb-packed 165km race to the steep slopes of Xorret de Catí. The first-category, 3.9km, 11.4% brute featured on the route for the first time since 2017, rounding off a day featuring three second-category climbs as well as a third-category hill. With many mountain points on offer, the battle for the break would be a big one as dozens of riders sought to get out front during the early kilometres of the stage. A group of 14 including 2017 Vuelta stage winner Thomas De Gendt (Lotto-Dstny) made it away on the first climb of the day, the second-category Alto de Vall d’Ebo (7.9km at 5.7%), but things came back together by the top as Jesus Herrada (Cofidis) snuck out to pick up five mountain points. The descent and the hilly ride to the next climb, the third-category Puerto de Tollos, would see an even larger group jump away at the front, with both De Gendt and Herrada in there along with other major names including Damiano Caruso (Bahrain Victorious), Bauke Mollema (Lidl-Trek), Rui Costa (Intermarché-Circus-Wanty), Finn Fischer Black (UAE Team Emirates), and Romain Bardet (dsm-firmenich). A total of 30 men made the break, which was left to race four minutes up the road by Groupama-FDJ, working in the peloton on behalf of race leader Lenny Martinez. Out front, Herrada grabbed three points on the Puerto de Tollos to move to second in the mountain classification on 12, nine down on Eduardo Sepulveda (Lotto-Dstny), while Cristian Rodriguez (Arkéa-Samsic) flirted with the virtual race lead. Shortly after the top of that second climb of the day, De Gendt decided to go it alone, pushing on once more and leaving the rest of the break behind him 112km from the line. The Belgian breakaway specialist quickly built a lead of a minute on the road to the next climb, the second-category Puerto de Benifallim (9.5km at 4.9%). Meanwhile, the peloton lay at five minutes down the road. He’d last out front alone until the top of the climb, but a counter-attack behind would soon scoop him up on the way down the other side, with Rui Costa, Javier Romo (Astana Qazaqstan), Antonio Tiberi (Bahrain Victorious), Oier Lazkano (Movistar) and Cristian Rodriguez (Arkéa-Samsic) jumping from the chasing breakaway group. De Gendt would quickly drop from the lead, but it wouldn’t be long before his Lotto-Dstny team had another representative up front as Andreas Kron joined Nicolas Prodhomme (AG2R Citroën) and Kenny Elissonde (Lidl-Trek) bridged to the front. They made it across with 64km to go at the start of the next climb, the Puerto de la Carrasqueta (10.9km at 4.6%), though midway up it was all back together as the main breakaway group brought the leaders back. The situation didn’t stay the same for long, however, as Caruso, Lazkano, Costa, Sylvain Moniquet (Lotto Dstny) and Welay Hagos Berhe (Jayco-AlUla) broke off the front in the final kilometres of the climb. It was soon eight out front as Bardet, Rodriguez, and Tiberi joined the quintet on the way down the other side. The attacks would keep on coming as the riders raced into the final 50km, working their way towards Xorret de Catí. Costa, Lazkano, Kron, and Caruso were out front as a quartet by the intermediate sprint with 40km to go, while the peloton followed some three minutes back with Jumbo-Visma and Groupama-FDJ still leading the way. The situation remained largely the same on the hilly run towards Xorret de Catí, with the bulk of the break swallowed up by the peloton on the way and the leaders’ advantage falling to a minute as Lennert Van Eetvelt (Lotto-Dstny) and Diego Camargo (EF Education-EasyPost) held out in between the two groups. Heading into the final 10km of the stage, the four leaders held a gap of just 50 seconds to the peloton as Van Eetvelt and Camargo were caught. Back in the peloton, as they had been doing for some time, it was Jumbo-Visma who led the charge towards the climb. They hit the steep slopes of Xorret de Catí 30 seconds down on the break, but it was only a matter of time for the quartet of survivors as the seconds melted away on the road uphill. They’d be caught 5km from the line but even before then there were big names dropping as Martinez and Geraint Thomas (Ineos Grenadiers) struggled with the pace and the gradients. Kuss made his move at the 5km mark, prompting Evenepoel to set the pace behind in what was an elite selection of just six favourites – Roglič, Vingegaard, Mas, Ayuso, Soler – with Almeida and Hugh Carthy (EF Education-EasyPost) battling just behind. Kuss seemed to be out front for an age but in reality it was little under a kilometre before Evenepoel dragged him back, making it an eight-man group as Almeida joined the back. But the Portuguese rider, his teammate Soler, and Kuss, would drop shortly before the top leaving a battle to get back for the finish. On the way down the other side, Evenepoel continued to lead the way, putting Mas in some difficulty heading downhill. However, it all came back together inside the final kilometre, setting up a grandstand sprint finish. At the line it turned out to be an Evenepoel-Roglič head-to-head battle, with the Slovenian securing what would be a double victory for Jumbo-Visma as Kuss raced into the red jersey at the expense of the long-dropped Martinez.

        "King Charles dons a kilt and shares a giggle with sister Anne as the siblings attend their mother's favourite event the Highland Games for the first time since she died The games were a favourite of the late Queen who rarely missed the spectacle By Christian Oliver Updated: 11:56 EDT, 2 September 2023 e-mail 66 shares 445 View comments King Charles III has paid tribute to his late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, as he attended the Highland Games today - an event that was a firm favourite of the monarch. The King represented the Royal Family at the event alongside his wife Queen Camilla - the first since Queen Elizabeth's death. The King and Queen were joined by Anne, Princess Royal, and her husband Sir Timothy Laurence, as the royal siblings sat next to each other and shared a giggle. The Braemar Gathering - the most famous of the Highland Games - was a particular favourite of the late Queen Elizabeth, who rarely missed the spectacle which takes place in September each year near Balmoral Castle , Aberdeenshire. It comes a year after the late Queen was forced to miss the event - prompting the initial grave concerns for her health, and less than a week before her passing. King Charles, Queen Camilla and Anne, the Princess Royal, were pictured laughing together as they attended the Braemar Royal Highland Gathering at the Princess Royal and Duke of Fife Memorial Park Queen Camilla smiled at the crowd as she attended the Braemar Gathering alongside her husband, King Charles III Anne, Princess Royal, wore a red jacket and a tartan skirt as she attended the Braemar Gathering with King Charles and Queen Camilla King Charles III and Queen Camilla during the Braemar Gathering highland games held a short distance from the royals' summer retreat at the Balmoral estate in Aberdeenshire Britain's King Charles III and Britain's Queen Camilla arrive to attend the annual Braemar Gathering in Braemar, Scotland Vice Admiral Timothy Laurence (left), Britain's King Charles III (centre), Britain's Queen Camilla (right) and Britain's Princess Anne, Princess Royal (third left) attend the annual Braemar Gathering in Braemar The late Queen Elizabeth II is pictured at the Braemar Highland Games in September 2010 alongside her son, then Prince Charles, Prince of Wales Prince Charles would often accompany the monarch at the gathering which has existed in some form for 900 years - and its most modern form stretching's back nearly 200 years. Then the Prince of Wales, Charles still attended the event last year despite officials saying at the time that the the decision was made that the late Queen wound not be there 'for her comfort'. The festival is known to attract visitors from all over the world and frequently featurs competitors from Scotland, England, Australia and America. Various events throughout the day include traditional Scottish games, including caber-tossing and tug-of-war, and take place at the Princess Royal and Duke of Fife Memorial Park in Braemar. The Braemar Gathering is the most famous of the Highland Games and is known worldwide. Each year thousands of visitors descend on this small Scottish village on the first Saturday in September to watch one of the more colourful Scottish traditions.

'The green, blue and red tartan was designed by The Scottish Tartans Authority earlier this year to mark the occasion of the coronation and in recognition of His Majesty's strong support in preserving the culture and traditions of highland dress and Scottish tartans,' the Scottish Tartans Authority said of the tartan. 'The unique design presented to His Majesty, is based on the Balmoral tartan sett which dates from c.1850 and continues to be worn by the King and members of the royal family today. 'The new tartan has been officially registered with the Scottish register of tartans which is administered by the National Records of Scotland. 'The cloth, woven in 100% Scottish wool by Lochcarron of Scotland in Selkirk, includes a central triple stripe motif (one broad and two narrow) which is a feature of royal tartans previously worn by His Majesty including the Duke of Rothesay, Duke of Rothesay Hunting and Lord of the Isles Hunting tartans. 'The colours have been matched to the natural dyes of 18th century tartan specimens in the collection of the Scottish Tartans Authority.'

It comes almost a year to the day after the late Queen Elizabeth was forced to miss the event over her ailing health and mobility issues. She would pass away some days later. Attending in place of his mother last year, the then Price Charles officially opened The Queen Elizabeth Platinum Jubilee Archway during the festival before presenting awards to the top-performing competitors as the events across the day. The Archway was opened last year to commemorate the Queen's historic 70 years on the throne in recognition of Her Majesty as a patron of the world-famous event. While she could not attended in person last year, the late Queen was able to watch from the comfort of Balmoral as the events were streamed online.

        "Typhoon Hanna maintained its strength while moving over the sea east of Taiwan, the state weather bureau PAGASA said late Saturday evening. Batanes remained under Signal No. 1 as Hanna, carrying maximum sustained winds of 140 kilometers per hour near the center and gustiness of up to 170 km/h, was spotted 295 km northeast of Itbayat, Batanes, at 10 p.m. It was moving west northwestward at 20 km/h. Meanwhile, the Southwest Monsoon (Habagat), which is currently enhanced by Hanna, will bring occasional to monsoon rains over the western portion of Luzon and Antique in the next three days. A gale warning is in effect for the northern and western seaboards of Luzon, the eastern seaboards of Central and Southern Luzon, portions of the seaboards of Northern Quezon, the southern seaboard of Southern Luzon, and the western seaboard of Visayas due to the combined influence of Hanna and the enhanced Southwest Monsoon. Hanna is forecast to move west northwestward or westward while intensifying until it makes landfall along the east coast of southern Taiwan on Sunday afternoon or evening. It is expected to exit the Philippine Area of Responsibility and emerge over the Taiwan Strait on Monday morning.",

        "Leading sports business consultant and journalist, Shogo Shodunke, believes that Kwara can tap into football talent exports to make outstanding revenue repatriation in the league off-seasons while also explaining that this belief informs the idea behind Saturday’s unveiling of ABS Football Club Talent Hunt and Development Program. As part of its program to resume the league season after returning to the NNL after relegation, the club believed to have exported more talents across the globe in recent times, unvailed the talent hunt project, its new technical adviser for the season, Umar Danlami Kwasau and also stated its resolve to win promotion to the elite league, NPFL, by the end of the season. Speaking on the money spinning potentials of soccer talent export, Shodunke reterated that nothing makes for easier revenue and prosperity generation than encouraging and nurturing talents. “In Lagos alone, we can say that about N7.2 billion was remitted into the state in the off-season by players from abroad. This was when the likes of Victor Osimhe and others returned during the off seasons. “All we got was Taiwo Awoniyi who put in about N50 million into Kwara which still small. The transfer of Awoniyi was about N16 billion, compared to what he put into competition and other investments, is quite small,” he said. According to Shodunke, some of these money find its way into properties, education and more sports promotion and the economy and society benefit from them. “We are trying to see where we can create a place where we can have young talents. We have seen that Kwara happens to be one of the best places where we can have young talents. “Apart from our own projects, we have been able to produce over 162 players in just eight years. POLL “We have a lot of players all over the places but we have not been able to get returns on them. We are producing and not getting returns. “But now we have to be calculating in what we do. “If we send players abroad, we want the returns to come back to the society,” Shodunke said. “The sports consultant currently works with ABS. Speaking further on the project, Chief Alloy Chukwuemeka, Director of Football, ABS, the man in charge of the entire project, the Talent hunt is the soccer club’s newest product. “This programme is targeted at youths of under 18-21 and will be selected from six centers from 6 geopolitical zones of Nigeria namely Kaduna, Bauchi, Ilorin, Ado Ekiti, Owerri and Calabar. “It’s basically to expose young talented footballers to seek careers abroad as part of efforts aimed at youth development and growth of football,” Chief Chukwuemeka said. Also, the players are to be scouted from six designated, Kaduna for North West; Bauchi for North East; Ilorin for North Central; Calabar for South South; Owerri for South East and Ado Ekiti for South West.",

        "“Xi’s ‘Action Men’ Now Lead China’s Military: What This Means for Taiwan’s Future” In a startling development that has sent ripples of concern across the Asia-Pacific region, China has unveiled its new military leadership, raising questions about the future of Taiwan’s sovereignty. The recent lineup announcement of the Central Military Commission (CMC) , the highest authority governing the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), has drawn attention to a group of officers referred to as “action men.” These officers are renowned for their expertise in critical areas that would play a pivotal role in any potential invasion. This revelation has heightened worries about the possibility of military aggression against Taiwan. China’s unveiling of its new military leadership comes on the heels of a significant declaration by President Xi Jinping during the Chinese Communist Party’s National Congress. In his address, Xi reaffirmed his determination to bring Taiwan under Beijing’s control. While he emphasized the potential for a peaceful reunification, he notably declined to rule out the use of force, adhering to China’s longstanding stance. The presence of these “action men” in key military positions raises several critical questions and concerns, not only for Taiwan but also for regional stability and global geopolitics. Understanding the ‘Action Men’ The term “action men” denotes officers within the PLA who have garnered recognition for their exceptional expertise and experience in areas crucial to a potential military offensive. These areas include strategy, logistics, naval operations, and cyber warfare. The appointment of these officers to prominent positions within the CMC suggests a deliberate focus on assembling a military leadership capable of executing complex and coordinated military operations. This move has led to speculation that China is actively preparing for various scenarios related to Taiwan, including the possibility of reunification through force. The prominence of these “action men” underscores China’s commitment to being prepared for any eventuality, signaling a willingness to employ a range of options to achieve its goals. Concerns Over Taiwan’s Sovereignty Taiwan, officially known as the Republic of China, has long been a sensitive issue in China’s foreign policy. Beijing regards Taiwan as a part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve reunification. Taiwan, on the other hand, operates as a separate, self-governing entity with its government, military, and democratic institutions. The increased presence of these “action men” in China’s military leadership raises concerns that Beijing might be moving closer to pursuing a military solution to the Taiwan issue. The implications of this possibility are far-reaching and include the potential for a regional conflict with global repercussions. Global Ramifications A military confrontation over Taiwan would not only have profound consequences for the region but also impact global dynamics. The Asia-Pacific region is home to several major powers, including the United States, Japan, and South Korea. Any escalation of tensions in the Taiwan Strait could quickly draw in these countries due to their strategic interests in the region. The United States, in particular, has a longstanding commitment to Taiwan’s defense and has supplied arms to the island. A military conflict in the Taiwan Strait would risk triggering a significant international crisis, potentially leading to a broader conflict involving major global powers. Xi Jinping’s Strategic Ambiguity It is essential to analyze President Xi Jinping’s statements regarding Taiwan in a broader context. While he has not ruled out the use of force, Xi has consistently expressed a preference for a peaceful reunification with Taiwan. This strategic ambiguity serves multiple purposes for Beijing. First, it allows China to maintain pressure on Taiwan without necessarily resorting to military action. Beijing’s assertive actions in the region, such as increased military drills near Taiwan and diplomatic isolation efforts, are part of this approach. Second, it enables China to assess international reactions and responses to its actions in the Taiwan Strait. By keeping the threat of force on the table, China maintains a bargaining chip in negotiations and exercises leverage over Taiwan’s actions. Analyzing China’s Intentions China’s military leadership under the guidance of President Xi Jinping’s administration is undoubtedly a significant factor in the evolving situation in the Taiwan Strait. However, interpreting China’s intentions remains a complex endeavor. While the presence of “action men” in key military positions underscores China’s preparedness for various scenarios, it does not guarantee a shift towards military aggression. China’s leadership may be utilizing this display of military strength to negotiate from a position of advantage, pressing Taiwan and other regional actors to align more closely with Beijing’s preferences. Additionally, China’s military capabilities, while formidable, would face significant challenges in conducting a successful military campaign against Taiwan, including the prospect of U.S. intervention. The Way Forward As tensions simmer in the Taiwan Strait, the international community must remain vigilant and committed to preserving regional stability and peace. Diplomatic efforts should continue to be the primary means of addressing the Taiwan issue. Open channels of communication between all parties involved, including the United States, China, and Taiwan, are essential for conflict prevention. The United States’ role as a security partner to Taiwan requires a delicate balance between supporting Taiwan’s defense needs and avoiding provocation. The presence of “action men” in China’s military leadership undoubtedly raises concerns, but it is not a definitive sign of imminent military action. Careful observation, dialogue, and diplomacy will be crucial in navigating the complex dynamics of the Taiwan Strait while seeking peaceful solutions to the longstanding issue of Taiwan’s status.",

        "Federal scientists will be monitoring global research to determine the effectiveness of updated vaccines against the latest COVID-19 variant, Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada say. Canada’s first known case of the Omicron variant BA.2.86 was detected this week in British Columbia as the country became the seventh in the world to report its presence. READ ALSO: B.C. confirms 1st case of new COVID variant Health Canada is currently reviewing applications for Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech’s new mRNA vaccines, developed against the dominant XBB.1.5 variant ahead of a vaccination campaign set for the fall. As of this week, there were only 13 sequences of the highly mutated variant BA. 2.86 available to analyze across six other countries — four in Denmark, three in the United States, two in Portugal, two in South Africa, one in Israel, and one in the United Kingdom, Health Canada and PHAC said in an email. “Scientists are looking for signs that BA.2.86 lineages would change disease severity or spread, or impact the effectiveness of diagnostic tests, vaccines or treatments for COVID-19,” they said. “As this new variant was just detected in Canada, it is difficult to have an understanding of its prevalence. As laboratories’ and clinical data is reported to PHAC, a more accurate picture will begin to emerge.” COVID-19 cases involving the XBB.1.5 variant are currently at a low to moderate level, with stable or increasing trends in all reporting provinces and territories, Health Canada and PHAC said. However, a hospital in Windsor, Ont., and another in Montague, P.E.I., announced outbreaks of the illness this week. The BA.2.86 variant was detected in a B.C. resident who had not recently been outside the country, provincial authorities said this week. Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry and Health Minister Adrian Dix said in a joint statement that there doesn’t seem to be increased illness severity with the strain and the infected person was not in hospital. Federal figures show that, as of mid-June, 80.5 per cent of Canadians had received their primary series of COVID vaccines. The highest uptake, at nearly 92 per cent, was in Newfoundland and Labrador. The lowest, at 75.5 per cent, was in the Northwest Territories, followed by Alberta, where 76 per cent of people were vaccinated. Dawn Bowdish, an immunologist at McMaster University in Hamilton, said it’s understandable that people are tired of COVID-19 amid a mostly normal return to social activities, but the mutating virus puts vulnerable populations, including the elderly, most at risk of infection. However, only about 21 per cent of Canadians aged 80 and over have received boosters or completed a primary vaccination series in the last six months, she said. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) has recommended Canadians roll up their sleeves for a booster in the fall if it has been at least six months since their last dose or COVID-19 infection. Bowdish said anyone starting chemotherapy or having major surgery may consider getting a booster before the reformulated vaccines are available but it’s otherwise best to wait. Parts of the Southern Hemisphere have faced a triple threat during its respiratory season, which usually starts in April and ends in September in that region. “They had a lot of influenza, they had a lot of RSV. They had a lot of COVID and they reported a lot of health-care worker absences, which means care for all things is impaired,” she said of Australia’s recent experience. However, Australians had access to the current bivalent COVID vaccines, not the reformulated ones. “What I worry about is it doesn’t need to be any worse or as bad as last year to still majorly impact health care for Canadians,” Bowdish said of a respiratory season that saw shortages of children’s pain relievers and long waits in emergency rooms. Bowdish is hoping Canadians won’t hesitate to get a booster this fall, when they could be vaccinated against influenza at the same time. For people over 60, a vaccine for RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, may also be available. Earlier this month, Health Canada announced the approval of a vaccine for RSV for those aged 60 and up, but it’s up to the provinces and territories to decide if and when Arexvy will be included in their vaccination programs. Eric Arts, a virologist at Western University in London, Ont., noted many Canadians are getting to the one-year mark since their last booster so it will be important to get vaccinated in the fall. The updated vaccines’ formula will be a minor change from current vaccines but with better protection against circulating Omicron variants, he said. “Hopefully, the bureaucracy will be fast to get them out.” This report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 1, 2023.

        "State government indulging in scams, abetting religious conversions and committing atrocities on people, he says",
      content:
        "Union Home Minister Amit Shah on September 2 launched an ‘Aaorp Patra’ [chargesheet or a catalogue of allegations] against the Bhupesh Baghel-led Congress government in Chhattisgarh alleging that it was deeply entrenched in corruption, dynastic politics and casteism. Accusing the State government of indulging in scams, abetting religious conversions and committing atrocities, Mr. Shah said that as far as the people were concerned, the Congress regime was equivalent to “tasting poison”. “The people of Chhattisgarh have to decide whether they want the Baghel-led government that indulges in corruption to the tune of thousands of crores or the BJP government which is going to lead them on the path of development. The people of Chhattisgarh have to decide whether they want the government that came to power on the promise of protecting tribal rights but allowed a wave of religious conversions to be unleashed,” he said, while exuding confidence that the BJP would win the Assembly election due later this year. Referring to the recent money laundering case related to the Mahadev online betting app, he asked whether the people of Chhattisgarh wanted a government that was pushing youth to online betting or a BJP government that ensured the welfare of youths. “And now they [those in government] are afraid that their names may be spilled by the ones who have been sent to jail. In coal [levy], a scandal of ₹2,000 crore has taken place in which [a commission of] ₹25 per tonne has been fixed. A scandal of ₹4,000 crore has taken place in forest department tenders,” he added. The Baghel-led government had broken all records of corruption, he said, adding that if the BJP is elected to power, those who indulged in graft would be “hung upside down”. He termed the government an “ATM for Delhi Durbar”, a reference to the Congress’ national leadership and the Gandhi family that the BJP has often mentioned in the past. Incidentally, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi also addressed a public meeting in Raipur. The BJP leader also targeted the State government over unfulfilled promises. “He [Mr. Baghel] made 36 big promises and 19 of them remain unfulfilled. Among the smaller promises, 316 still remain unfulfilled. Let them publish the list of unfulfilled promises. Even if they don’t, we have published the complete list of your false promises in our ‘Aarop Patra’ ,” said Mr. Shah.",
